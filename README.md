# This is Yifan Lu's temporary digital warehouse

Yifan Lu is still struggling on constructing his own system, so do not blame him too much is anything on this site is empty or anything went wrong.

To see my Web front-page, please visit https://yifanlu.page, and you'll be able to find other things I do uder the **Repo** page.

To see what's going on in my Chinese World, please visit https://null102.zone; come visit https://onclub.golf and you'll find him and his homie there if we speak the same language.

## What is null102 and who is Yifan Lu is

Yifan Lu is currently a student at [California Institute of the Arts](https://calarts.edu) and he's been having **ADHD** for his whole life. If you see
a username called null102 anywhere on Internet, it's mostly likely Yifan Lu's ID. Yifan Lu also unses null102 as his name in the **Chinese Underground
Culture Label [ONCLUB](https://onclub.golf).**

The https://yifanlu.page website was initially https://yifanlu.github.io which belongs to his another Github account called Yifan Lu, then transferred to
null102 since he feels switching between two Github accounts is bit annoying.
